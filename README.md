NBT client
=====================================

The default NBT client is implemented entirely within an HTML5 environment hosted in a modern web browser. 

The preferred development framework is AngularJS (http://angularjs.org) and Twitter Bootstrap 3 CSS/JS. 3D accelerated graphics use three.js (http://threejs.org). 

NBT client UI development can use a test API hosted at https://api-dev.netbattletech.com. This API is backed by a test database (not the live NBT database). This API is fully RESTful, including HATEOAS. Documentation on the API, therefore, is limited to description of the supported hypermedia types (documentation TBD).
