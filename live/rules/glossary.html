<div class="glossary-combat-unit" style="display: none">
    <h5 class="nbt-h5">Combat Unit</h5>
    <div class="nbt-rules-para">
        A Combat Unit is any item in an NBT league's associated game that can be played in the game. For instance, in a
        Mechwarrior-based game, combat units typically are limited to Battlemechs. In a tabletop-based game such as MegaMek
        or Battletech, the range of combat units playable in the game is much wider and deeper, and can include items such
        as infantry, tanks, aerospace fighters, and so on.

        star(s) and transferring it to the energy source for the Kearny-Fuchida faster-than-light (FTL) drive in a
