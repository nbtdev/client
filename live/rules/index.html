        <h1>An Introduction To NBT: The NetBattleTech League System</h1>
        <div class="nbt-para">
            NBT is one of the oldest planetary resource leagues in existence.
            It has evolved through several incarnations, starting in the mid-1990’s with Activision’s Mechwarrior2: Mercenaries;
            continued through Microsoft’s Mechwarrior 4: Vengeance, Black Knight & Mercenaries editions; flourished with the Hardcore
            and MekTek community mods to the MW4 engine; and is reborn for Pirhana Games Inc's Mechwarrior:Online and Harebrained Scheme's
            Battletech titles.
        </div>

        <div class="nbt-para">
            What exactly is a "planetary" league? In a "planetary" league, teams battle for control over a map of one or more galaxies.
            In the context of the Battletech Universe, there is one galaxy (ours), set in a particular timeline. Groups of planets are
            owned by factions, who are responsible for planning for their defense, and, optionally, expanding their empire by attacking
            other factions. Attacks and defends are subject to the resources a faction has available to them; in a Mechwarrior-based league,
            those resources would be mechs; in a league that supports a deeper set of combat units, the types of resources would expand to
            include all types of combat units supported by the particular game.
        </div>

        <div class="nbt-para">
            In order to obtain the resources necessary to prosecute attacks and execute defenses, a faction must purchase the combat units
            (and means of transport required to move them around the galaxy(s)) -- this introduces the concept of an economy. And where
            an economy can thrive, it can also be disrupted, to the detriment of factions who may have been planning on a certain level
            of economic output to implement their offensive and defensive strategies.
            Optionally, a faction may decide simply to take what they need from their neighbors. Of course, those neighbors are not
            likely just to give the aggressor what they want, so the matter must be settled via combat.
        </div>

        <div class="nbt-para">
            The NBT League System supports all manner of peaceful and forceful exchange of resources and assets (planets); a faction can purchse
            the combat units it needs from its own factories (or the factories of its allies), using the economic output of its own planets; it
            can raid enemies and endeavour to steal their resources (combat units, economic assets, and so on); it can launch full-scale
            assaults on enemy space in an attempt to take control of the enemy planets and the assets on those planets.
        </div>

        <div class="nbt-para">
            Any action that results in combat is decided in the game or simulator associated with the league. In a Mechwarrior:Online-based
            league, those battles are fought in the MWO game client. In a Battletech-based league, the outcome of the action is decided in the
            Battletech game client. In this way, the NBT League System can be thought to provide a "strategic meta-game" around the actual
            game involved, providing a depth to the game experience not possible just by playing the game itself. NBT can "give meaning" to
            playing the game, in other words.
        </div>

        <div class="nbt-para">
            With all of the above in mind, NBT can most accurately be described as a "resource-based planetary league". One of the key differences
            between NBT and more straightforward tournament-style leagues, is that "resources matter". When attacking or defending, a faction
            may only use what combat resources ('Mechs, etc.) it has available on the planet(s) or dropship(s) involved. For example, if attacked
            and the defender has only, say, Battlemaster and Raven mechs on the target planet, they may only use Battlemasters and Ravens in the
            planet's defense. Much of the depth offered by NBT involves the level of planning involved in making sure that the most valuable
            planets are properly defended, or attacks prosecuted with the equipment necessary for best chance of success.
        </div>

        <div class="nbt-para">
            Additional depth is provided by the ability to affect the strategies of your opponents. For example, a faction may launch a series
            of raids designed to cripple an opponent's ability to resupply their defenses, in the preparatory phase of a broader plan to assault
            the opponent's space...or perhaps simply to ease pressure by the opponent on a faction allied with the attacker. The reasons for any
            action in an NBT League are bounded only by the cunning of the team controlling the faction. In many ways, the NBT meta-game resembles
            a classic strategy game such as chess, in that not every action may be what it seems and motives are often hidden until the strategy
            plays itself out.
        </div>

        <div class="nbt-para">
            NBT also distinguishes itself from tournament-style leagues in that role-play is a central aspect of the league; when a team accepts control
            of a faction in an NBT league, they are expected (in some cases, required) to role-play their faction to the best of their ability.
            This does not mean following canon to the letter; in fact, NBT encourages whatever departure from canon a team wishes, to the extent
            that the departure is roleplayed as well. NBT proudly creates its own history in the BattleTech Universe.
        </div>

        <div class="nbt-para">
            In short, as long as there is a multiplayer Battletech-based game that can benefit from the additional depth of experience that
            NBT provides, NBT will be there to provide it!
