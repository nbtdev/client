        Similar to Sector Raids, the Sector Assault uses a dedicated "tracker" to manage the state of the battle. The
        tracker generates all drop conditions (map, environment, tonnage, game mode, etc.) after the first drop (which
        is generated and distributed with the Sector Assault forcedec), and for that reason, it is required that teams
        log the battle progress as each drop is completed; as we will see, it most cases the tracker cannot know what
        state the battle will be in beyond the current drop.

            <div class="nbt-rules-para">
                The Sector Assault battle type in NBT is a multiple-drop battle, fought in different "phases". There are two
                phases in an NBT Sector Assault: "Assault" and "Siege". The "Assault" phase models the attacker's push to
                the sector capital, and the "Siege" phase models the attack on the sector capital itself.
            </div>

                <div class="nbt-rules-para">
                    The number of drops in the primary "Assault" phase is determined by the number of planets in the sector
                    being contested, and the success of each contestant in the battle. As the Assault phase models the
                    march of the attacker towards the sector capital, this phase is considered to be fought on each
                    non-capital ("member") planet in the sector, in sequence. In order to proceed to the Siege phase, the attacker
                    must "capture-and-hold" the majority of member planets in the sector, at which time the assault moves
                    to the Siege phase. If the attacker fails to capture-and-hold a majority of member planets in the
                    sector, they are repelled from the sector and the defender is considered victorious in the Sector
                    Assault, and retains control.

                <div class="nbt-rules-para">
                    As part of launching the battle, the Attacker will have chosen the order in which the member planets
                    will be contested; this models the "due diligence" the attacker would have exercised in preparing for
                    the battle (as it is expected they would have tailored their forces and strategy to the terrain
                    classes of the member planets in the sector). The actual maps to be played are chosen from the list of
                    maps associated with the particular terrain classes of the planets when the drops for those planets
                    are generated.

                    The "capture-and-hold" mechanic is implemented as follows:

                        <li>When the battle moves to Member Planet "A", a single drop is played for the "capture" of the

                            becomes the defender and the defender becomes the attacker, for that drop).

                            considered victorious in the battle.

                    In this example sector, there are ten planets, one of which is the sector capital (Saltillo). Therefore,
                    in order to proceed to the Siege phase, the attacker will need to capture, and hold, 5 of the 9
                    member planets in the sector. In this case, the minimum number of drops in the assault could be 5 --
                    if the defender wins all of the Assault drops, the battle is over. The maximum number of drops in
                    this Assault phase could be 18 -- assuming the attacker captured 9, held 4 and failed to hold 4, and
                    the final "hold" drop (the 18th drop in the Assault phase) is to determine whether or not the assault
                    is over, or moves onto Siege phase.

                <div class="nbt-rules-para">

                        The first drop of the Sector Assault will be a "capture" drop for Tamarind, and the conditions for this

                        drops in the Assault phase; the tracker can only generate drop conditions once the current drop
                        is completed (and logged, which makes it vital that teams log each drop as the battle is played).

                        of defender, and the defender will play the role of attacker, for this drop only.

                        Tamarind is under their control, and they need only to capture and hold 4 more planets in the sector.
                        Even if the attacker lost the hold drop (and the defender maintains control of Tamarind for the
                        duration of this Assault phase), the tracker will move the battle to the next planet, Millungera,
                        for the "capture" drop, and the attacker and defender return to their original roles.

                        however, need to capture and hold only 4 of the remaining 7 planets "in play" in the sector for this
                        Assault phase, if they wish to move the assault to Siege.

            <div class="nbt-rules-para">
                The Siege phase of a Sector Assault models the final assault on the sector capital itself. Since the
                capital of any sector is expected to have the toughest defenses, a single drop or two does not suffice
                to determine control of the capital, and therefore the sector. The battle for the sector capital is
                fought as a best-of-5, on maps chosen from the sector capital's terrain class rotation, with generally
                higher tonnages or BV than were used in the Assault phase. If the attacker wins 3 of the 5 Siege drops,
                they are considered victorious and are awarded control of the sector. If the defender wins 3 of the 5
                Siege drops, the battle is put back into the Assault phase, and the number of planets put back "in play"
                is determined by the success of the defender during Siege; a 3-0 romp in Siege will push the attacker
                farther back (more member planets restored to defender control) than will a 3-2 squeaker. The number
                of planets restored to defender control (if the defender wins Siege) is equal to the difference between
                the numbers of drops won by the defender and the attacker; a 3-0 win means 3 planets randomly restored
                to defender control, 3-1 means 2 planets, 3-2 means one planet.

                    As the Sector Assault is considered to be a march through a sector, planet by planet, it is possible

                <div class="nbt-rules-para">
                    After each drop, the winner of the drop will be offered the opportunity to repair one or more combat
                    units that were destroyed on the drop. The number of choices offered will be scaled in direct proportion
                    to the margin of success; an 8-0 win will provide more choices than an 8-7 win (even though there
                    are more destroyed units - 15 instead of 8 - available). In addition, the number of repairs that can
                    be made increases in direct proportion to the success on the drop; a margin of victory of 6-8
                    will allow the victor to repair up to 3 destroyed units; a margin of 3-5 will allow 2, and a margin
                    of 1 or 2 will allow 1. For game modes that have an alternate objective condition for success, the
                    victor is considered to have won by a margin of 8, and will be offered the maximum number of units
                    to repair, or the number of total units (friendly and enemy) actually destroyed on the drop, whichever
                    is less. So if a drop is won on objectives with a 2-0 score, only 2 units can be repaired, even though
                    the victor technically would be eligible for 3.

                    faction, with the proper permissions necessary to log Sector Assault battle drops, must be present
                    during those drops. The allies are not able to log drops in the Sector Assault on their own.

                    <span class="highlight">Final Battle Logging:</span> Sector Assault battle logging and confirmation
                    are integrated into the Sector Assault tracker. All of the steps described below are found in the
                    Sector Assault tracker interface.
                    When victory conditions are met or a retreat has been performed by either side, the two primary factions
                    will log and confirm the battle in the following manner:
                    <ol class="nbt-ordered-list">
                        <li>Attacker will confirm their combat units used and destroyed, and submit this with the outcome
                            (Attacker Victorious, Defender Victorious, Attacker Retreat, Defender Retreat) using the
                            Sector Assault tracker interface.
                        </li>
                        <li>Defender will confirm the attacker's units used and lost, and confirm the battle outcome. If
                            any discrepancies are found, the defender will reject the attacker's submission and the logging
                            will return to step (1). Additionally, the two opponents should come to an agreement on the
                            discrepancy and the remedy, and the attacker should re-log. Otherwise, the defender (in case
                            of defeat or retreat) will be given the opportunity to pick up the military assets to which
                            they are entitled.
                        </li>
                        <li>Attacker will confirm the defender's units used and lost; if any discrepancies are discovered,
                            the attacker will reject the defender's submission and the logging will return to step (2). If
                            the attacker was not victorious in the Sector Assault, they will be given the opportunity to
                            pick up the remaining assets to which they are entitled (dropships are required on planet for
                            this step). Finally, the attacker will submit the battle results and the sector will be unlocked
                            (and if the attacker was victorious or the defender retreated, the sector ownership is
                            transferred to the attacker).
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                <div class="nbt-rules-para">
                    <span class="highlight">Forfeits:</span> A forfeit of an entire PA will result in administrative
                    logging of a victory for the opponent (not a retreat by the forfeiter). League administration will
                    also determine if the forfeited combat units are destroyed, captured or retreated, depending on
                    circumstances. On a single drop of an active Sector Assault, the forfeit will be logged by league
                    administration in favor of the opponent as an 8-0 victory, at the current tonnage/BV, with full bonuses.

                    units on either side of a drop have been destroyed, then the team that destroyed the most enemy
                    tonnage or BV is declared the winner. At least 50% of the enemy tonnage must be destroyed in
                    non-objective-based game modes in order to qualify for a win.
                    <div class="nbt-rules-para">
                        In the event that both sides destroyed equivalent tonnage,
                        or not enough tonnage of BV was destroyed to qualify for a win, or an objective-based drop timed out
                        without sufficient objectives met by either contestant, the drop is to be replayed with the same
                        conditions (maps, game mode, environment, tonnage/BV, etc.). Combat units destroyed on the drop will
                        remain destroyed; all others may be reused. Spawn points/lances/drop-zones may be changed and teams
                        may choose different combat units than they used on the tied drop.
