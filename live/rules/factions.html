        NBT leagues typically are organized by faction; it is the faction that owns and controls resources and planets
        on the league starmap. There currently are no solo-player leagues planned for NBT at this time.
        This mean that in order to participate in NBT, you must belong to team that controls a faction in the league.

        <div class="nbt-rules-para">
            Teams members are generally lumped into two broad categories -- Leader and Member. A team can have any number of
            members it likes, and can edit their roster as often as they like, with two restrictions:
        </div>
        <ol class="nbt-ordered-list">
            <li>No pilot can be on the roster for two factions at the same time in any given league.</li>
            <li>In order for a pilot to be "legal" for a league drop, they must be on the roster no less than one hour
                prior to the scheduled drop
            </li>
        </ol>
        <div class="nbt-rules-para">
            Pilot names are required to match the in-game name of the pilot exactly, including any spaces, odd characters
            and/or symbols, and capitalization. This is necessary for disambiguation, and it also enhances the ability for
            "auto-reporting" of league drop results with games that support such data transfer.
        </div>
        <div class="nbt-rules-para">
            Pilots are not required to register for the league automation to participate in league play. Pilots are
            encouraged
            to do so, however; registering in the league automation allows pilots to be more aware of what is happening
            in the league, with their team/faction, and so on. You will have the opportunity to review the NBT Privacy
            Policy

        <h2 class="nbt-h2">Faction Types</h2>
        NetBattleTech provides a league experience based on the BattleTech Universe (BTU). As such, all factions in any NBT
        league are one of the types listed below. Note: not all factions will be available in all NBT leagues; which factions
        are available (and what their common names are) depends on the league timeline, and the design of the league by the
        league administrator.
        <div class="nbt-rules-para">
            <h3 class="nbt-h3">Major Inner Sphere House</h3>
            <div>
                These factions form the backbone of any NBT league. They control
                the most space on the map and typically are controlled by the most reliable teams. NBT Administration will
                exercise the most due diligence and deliberation in assigning applicants to Inner Sphere Houses.
            </div>
            <div>
                Following is the complete list of Major Inner Sphere House factions (in alphabetical order):
                <ul class="nbt-unordered-list">
                    <li>House Davion (e.g., Federated Suns)</li>
                    <li>House Kurita (e.g. Draconis Combine)</li>
                    <li>House Liao (e.g., Capellan Confederation)</li>
                    <li>House Marik (e.g., Free Worlds League)</li>
                    <li>House Steiner (e.g., Lyran Alliance)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                You may wonder why Free Rasalhague Republic and St. Ives Compact are not on this list, even though they comprise
                significant portions of any Clan-invasion-era Inner Sphere map. Both are essentially
                breakaway factions of the larger Houses, where the list above (minus Terran Hegemony) are founding members of the
                Star League, on which much of the lore of BTU is based.
            </div>

            <div>
                The distinction actually has meaning in terms of launching any NBT league; any Inner Sphere faction tagged
                as a "Major House" must be filled and active before any NBT league will start. The list of Major Houses for
                a given NBT league may deviate from the list above, for that particular league, solely at the discretion of
                the league designer and administration.

            <div>
                In a timeline where these factions exist, they augment the backbone of their NBT league (along with the
                major
                houses). Given the nature of the Clan invasion in BTU, these factions typically already occupy part of the
                Inner Sphere (although whether or not an invasion exists is up to the designer and administrator of that
                particular league). Given the canonical significance of these factions, control of them will be given
                as much consideration by NBT Administration as is given the Major Houses.
            </div>
            <div>

            <div>
                Clan factions may or may not be tagged as "required" for NBT league start, at the sole discretion of the
                league designer and administration. Similary, the list of "Major Clan" factions is on a per-league basis
                and is at the sole descretion of the league designer and administration.

        <div class="nbt-rules-para">
            <h3 class="nbt-h3">Minor Clans</h3>
            <div>
                These Clan factions may be present in post-Invasion-timeline leagues and are typically restricted to the
                Clan homeworlds. They are not prohibited from interacting with Inner Sphere factions
                but generally will concentrate on intra-Clan activity in the Kerensky Cluster. Some examples of Minor
                Clan factions (including, but not limited to):
                <ul class="nbt-unordered-list">
                    <li>Clan Cloud Cobra</li>
                    <li>Clan Coyote</li>

        <div class="nbt-rules-para">
            <h3 class="nbt-h3">Periphery Kingdoms</h3>
            <div>
                These factions are smaller than their Inner Sphere Major House neighbors, and exist on the "periphery" of
                the Inner Sphere map. These factions are fiercely independent and generally distrustful of Star League
                factions in general. In terms of activity level in a given NBT league, these factions usually see a lower
                level of activity than Inner Sphere houses. Inclusion of any periphery faction is subject to the discretion
                of a given NBT league designer or administrator, and often will depend on the timeline of the league.
                Periphery faction examples include (but are not limited to):
                <ul class="nbt-unordered-list">
                    <li>Magistracy Of Canopus (House Centrella)</li>

        <div class="nbt-rules-para">
            <h3 class="nbt-h3">Mercenaries</h3>
            <div>
                As their name suggests, Mercenary factions operate as "guns for hire", providing their services to the
                highest bidder and with few exceptions, loyal only to the c-bill. Mercenaries generally work only for
                Inner Sphere Houses and periphery kingdoms, typically augmenting forces in employer actions and occasionally
                acting on their own, but generally always under contract.
            </div>

            <div>
                Opening of Mercenary factions for application is at the sole discretion of the designer and administration
                for a given NBT league. In general, however, when Mercenary factions are available to occupy, since NBT is
                based in BTU, canon-based Mercenary corporations will be filled first, before "custom" factions are made
                available.
            </div>

            <div>
                In canon, the Mercenary Review And Bonding Commission typically handles the ranking and review of
                Mercenary corps for the benefit of both employer and employee factions; whether an MRBC is active and
                in force in a given NBT league is left to the discretion of the league designer and administration.

        </div>

        <div class="nbt-rules-para">
            <h3 class="nbt-h3">Pirates</h3>
            <div>
                Pirate units in NBT are typically lean operations with no initial holdings other than combat units and the
                means to transport them. They are designed to live off of raids and theft to fund their operations, but
                if they are skilled enough they can amass the weaponry required to carry out an assault in an effort to
                gain control of territory. If a pirate unit gains a sector of space, they are automatically promoted to
                the level of a small periphery state. The presence of pirates in any given NBT league is at the sole discretion
                of the league designer and administration.

        <h2 class="nbt-h2">Applying For A Faction</h2>
        <div>
            Faction application periods and how factions are assigned to applicant teams, is at the discretion of that league's
            administration, but all faction applications share one thing in common: in order to apply for a faction, the applicant must have an account registered with the NBT Automation. This account
            will be the one intially assigned "the keys" to the faction. Any league-specific rules or restrictions pertaining
            to faction applications will be listed on the league-specific rules pages.

        <h2 class="nbt-h2">Setting Up A Faction</h2>
        <div>
            NBT Leagues may have their own specific rules for setting up a faction, but in general (or in the absence of any
            league-specific rules), the following apply:
        </div>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Once a team has the "keys" to the faction, they are allowed to begin setting up the faction. This includes
                choosing the initial <a href="/glossary/combat-unit">combat unit</a> allotment, and placing the initial
                <a href="/glossary/industry">industry</a> allotment. This is performed in the automation and the team can change
                their setup as often as they like up until they go "live" in their faction (at which point changes occur on the
                basis of combat and economic activity).
            </li>
            <li>
                During setup the team should also define any additional roles they would like, to grant various members of their
                team different levels of access to their faction. While access is defined in terms of roles, it is granted in terms
                of various areas of the faction's automation (viewing faction details on the starmap, for instance; or launching and
                logging battles; all the way up to full control of the faction). Given the battle logging rules defined elsewhere in
                these pages, it is recommended that teams at least provide a few members of their staff the ability to log battles
                on behalf of the team and the faction.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="/glossary/charge-station">Charge stations</a> in a faction's space are set up by league administration
                and are not subject to further customization by the team setting up the faction, either during initial setup or
                during the playing of the league.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="/glossary/jumpship">Jumpships</a> must be placed at a planet in the faction's space. Jumpships can all
                be placed around the same planet initially and jumped to their final destination if desired; note that jumps during
                setup will be free (and instantly recharge, regardless of the presence of a charge station), or placed strategically
                around the faction's space. After a team goes "live" with their faction, normal jump fees and recharging rules apply.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="/glossary/combat-unit">Combat units</a> must be placed on a planet during setup; once setup is complete and
                the faction "goes live", combat units may be loaded aboard transport for movement around the faction's space, or in
                execution of attacks on opponents. <span class="bold">During setup only</span>, the choice of combat units must follow
                limits and ratios (if any), as defined by the specific league. See the league-specific rules and restrictions for
                more.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="nbt-h2">Shutting Down A Faction</h2>
        <div class="nbt-rules-para">
            Sometimes, a team must cease to operate a faction. This can be for one or more valid reasons (low pilot turnout,
            the faction becomes unteanable due to fundamental losses of resources, etc.). Regardless the reason, NBT has some
            policies in place for such eventualities.
        </div>

        <div class="nbt-rules-para">
            When a team closes up shop, various actions are not allowed, and if attempted, will be immediately reversed or
            nullified by league administration:
            <ul class="nbt-unordered-list">
                <li>Selling of combat units and/or jumpships is prohibited</li>
                <li>Transferring sums of money (whether single lump transfers or "structured" transfers) to other factions is prohibited</li>
                <li>Transferring of combat units or jumpships to other factions is prohibited</li>
            </ul>

            Additionally, if funds are owed for any reason, NBT League Administration will handle the details and ensure all affected
            parties are made whole; teams are not to transfer huge sums on their way out the door.
        </div>

        <div class="nbt-rules-para">
            When a faction becomes untenable, options exist for the team occupying that faction to remain in the league, and possibly
            keep the faction name, if they like:
            <ul class="nbt-unordered-list">
                <li>
                    <div>
                        Faction materially eliminated from the league (lost all or most of their planets). Two options exist in this
                        scenario:
                        <ol class="nbt-ordered-list">
                            <li>
                                Team retains the faction name and become a Pirate or Mercenary faction. This would allow the team
                                to keep whatever resources (including remaining planets) they had from the former faction. They would
                                then gain the abilities of the chosen faction type (special jumps, for instance), as well as retain the
                                option to regain their faction's former status if they can build the faction back up to the required levels.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Close up shop entirely in Faction A, and take a completely new Mercenary or Pirate Faction B. This new
                                faction starts with that faction type's initial resource set, and any remaining resources from the previous
                                faction are lost. It would also be more difficult to upgrade to a larger faction at a later time.
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                    <div>
                        Logisitics and realities of life suggest that merging with another team may be a better course of action. For
                        example, low pilot turnout prevents the team from meeting all of a faction's obligations. As NBT prefers teams
                        and pilots to stay in the league, we offer an incentive for the team and/or pilots to remain.
                        <ol class="nbt-ordered-list">
                            <li>
                                Once the merger goes through and demonstrates success (typically 1-2 months after the merger is complete)
                                league administation will grant the faction that received the pilots, a modest booster pack, generally consisting
                                of combat units and/or c-bills, but actual contents are at the discretion of the league administration.

                                The original, shuttered faction must have been an established, active faction within the league. Gaming the system,
                                such as setting up a "front" faction and ghost-running it for a month then shutting it down, with no actual activity,
                                is prohibited and boosters will not be awarded in these cases (again, at the sole discretion of league administration).
