        The primary limited resource in any NBT league is money. Money is required for everything in NBT -- purchasing combat units,
        means of transport (jumpships, dropships, etc), making jumps themselves, upgrading factories, maintaining the stores of
        military equipment that provide for a faction's offensive and defensive capabilities, and so on. And since NBT provides
        a fluid league setting, nearly all costs will change dynamically as a function of the standard supply-and-demand
        curves from Economics 101.

    <div class="nbt-rules-para">
        It is not all expenses, however; factions receive regular income from the industrial output of their planets (or for
        planet-less factions such as Mercenaries, from the contracts they maintain with their employers). Additionally, factions
        with planets have the opportunity to upgrade the industrial output of their faction by re-investing revenue into
        industry. Thus a faction is forced to plan wisely to support their intended level of military activity (which always is
        more expensive than standard commercial activity).

        The unit of currency used in all NBT leagues is the

        <h2 class="nbt-h2">Income</h2>
        <div class="nbt-rules-para">
            In all NBT leagues, income payments are made each Sunday at the same time (specifically, 23:59:00 UTC). This allows
            factions to receive a regular stream of income. Immediately after income is collected, expenses are automatically
            paid out from the faction's account. Expenses include the maintenance costs for all battle equipment as well as keeping
            the economic and political wheels greased.
        </div>

        <div class="nbt-rules-para">
            Both income and expenses are handled on a monthly basis, and the weekly payout (and expense settlement) simply divides
            those monthly amounts by four (4). This means that 4 times a year, extra income is collected (and expenses paid).
        </div>

        <div class="nbt-rules-para">
            Each planet on the starmap has an industry level assigned to it. These levels are partially set during faction setup;
            the majority of a faction's startup industry is automatically placed (and can't be reduced, only augmented, by the faction)
            to prevent teams from concentrating all of their industry in their interior, away from the danger of enemy aggression. The
            amount of industry (monthly output) per planet can range from 0-500,000,000 c-bills (different leagues may
            impose different limits -- consult your league's rules for specifics). As mentioned, once a faction is live,
            the faction can invest in their planets' industry levels by purchasing additional output (on a per-planet basis) for
            between 5 and 13 (inclusive) times the amount of increases. So, for example, to increase a planet's output by 100,000,000
            c-bills, at an 8x multiplier, it would cost the faction 800,000,000 c-bills to perform the upgrade (this simulates, for
            example, the capital investment necessary to make a manufacturing firm more productive, etc.). The industry multiplier
            varies per day in the range prescribed above, on a random basis; whether this is a 1.0 probability curve or some other
            distribution is used, is solely at the discretion of the league designer and/or administrator, and will not be disclosed
            publicly.

        <div class="nbt-rules-para">
            <span class="bold">Maximum Income & Maximum Funds</span>. No unit may have more than a certain league-specific
            number of c-bills in their account. If they exceed this amount when funds are issued, a "worker's holiday"
            is declared and no income is received (but expenses are still paid). The goal of NBT is combat in the
            simulator/game, not hoarding cash. Funds are meant to enable combat between factions in the league, and are
            not themselves part of "victory conditions" (no "extra points" are awarded for having cash in the bank).
            Additionally, factions with more than X planets may not exceed an amount of industry equal to Y times the number
            of the faction's planets (where X and Y are prescribed on a per-league basis). These limits are at the
            discretion of the league administrator and once set for a season, will not change. The limits for a given
            league will be publicly posted as part of that league's specific rules.

        <div class="nbt-rules-para">
            <span class="bold">Selling Resources</span>. Another form of income can be realized by selling faction resources, generally via
            the Black Market. Two forms of sale can occur -- direct sale, where the item(s) in question are typically sold at a discount
            ("need the cash now", in other words); and "consignment" sale, where it may be possible to realize a premium price for the
            item(s) but the time and date of sale may be in the future. This second option is the only way for units to sell to one
            another, and is monitored closely by league administration for patterns of abuse. This method ALWAYS will
            be more expensive than buying the same item (if possible) on the open market (due to the involvement of the
            broker as middleman).

            The following table of jump costs is a base set of costs and may be changed on a per-league basis at any time by league
            administration. Additionally, a league designer or administrator may override these costs prior to the start of the league;
            in this case the custom values will be published in that league's specific ruleset.

            Unlike many governments in the real world, the faction governments in NBT may not run a deficit; in other words, factions
            may not spend "into the red" and wait for payday to make up the difference. Note that the league economy design does not
            prevent a faction from becoming "insolvent" -- incurring more costs per cycle than income in that cycle, and if a faction
            becomes insolvent, league administration may take steps to remedy the situation. What steps are involved will be decided on
            a case-by-case basis, but common remedies often include liquidating civilian and military assets to reduce the faction's
            cost burden to a sustainable level.
