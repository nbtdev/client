    <div>
        The primary limited resource in any NBT league is money. Money is required for everything in NBT -- purchasing combat units,
        means of transport (jumpships, dropships, etc), making jumps themselves, upgrading factories, maintaining the stores of
        military equipment that provide for a faction's offensive and defensive capabilities, and so on. And since NBT provides
        a fluid league setting, nearly all costs will change dynamically as a function of the standard supply-and-demand
        curves from Economics 101.
    </div>

    <div>
        It is not all expenses, however; factions receive regular income from the industrial output of their planets (or for
        planet-less factions such as Mercenaries, from the contracts they maintain with their employers). Additionally, factions
        with planets have the opportunity to upgrade the industrial output of their faction by re-investing revenue into
        industry. Thus a faction is forced to plan wisely to support their intended level of military activity (which always is
        more expensive than standard commercial activity).
    </div>

    <div>
        The unit of currency used in all NBT leagues is the
        <a href="/glossary/c-bill">c-bill</a>. While this may make for large numbers in some cases (especially when managing
        larger factions such as Major Houses), it is the standard currency used in BTU.
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Income</h2>
        <div>
            In all NBT leagues, income payments are made each Sunday at the same time (specifically, 23:59:00 UTC). This allows
            factions to receive a regular stream of income. Immediately after income is collected, expenses are automatically
            paid out from the faction's account. Expenses include the maintenance costs for all battle equipment as well as keeping
            the economic and political wheels greased.
        </div>

        <div>
            Both income and expenses are handled on a monthly basis, and the weekly payout (and expense settlement) simply divides
            those monthly amounts by four (4). This means that 4 times a year, extra income is collected (and expenses paid).
        </div>

        <div>
            Each planet on the starmap has an industry level assigned to it. These levels are partially set during faction setup;
            the majority of a faction's startup industry is automatically placed (and can't be reduced, only augmented, by the faction)
            to prevent teams from concentrating all of their industry in their interior, away from the danger of enemy aggression. The
            amount of industry (monthly output) per planet can range from 0-500,000,000 c-bills. As mentioned, once a faction is live,
            the faction can invest in their planets' industry levels by purchasing additional output (on a per-planet basis) for
            betwee 5 and 13 (inclusive) times the amount of increases. So, for example, to increase a planet's output by 100,000,000
            c-bills, at an 8x multiplier, it would cost the faction 800,000,000 c-bills to perform the upgrade (this simulates, for
            example, the capital investment necessary to make a manufacturing firm more productive, etc.). The industry multiplier
            varies per day in the range prescribed above, on a random basis; whether this is a 1.0 probability curve or some other
            distribution is used, is solely at the discretion of the league designer and/or administrator, and will not be disclosed
            publicly.
        </div>

        <div>
            <span class="bold">Maximum Income & Maximum Funds</span>. No unit may have more than 25,000,000,000 (25 billion) c-bills in
            their account. If they exceed this amount when funds are issued, a "worker's holiday" is declared and no income is received (but
            expenses are still paid). The goal of NBT is combat in the simulator/game, not hoarding cash. Funds are meant to enable
            combat between factions in the league, and are not themselves part of "victory conditions" (no "extra points" are awarded
            for having cash in the bank). Additionally, factions with 70+ planets may not exceed an amount of industry equal to 125,000,000
            times the number of the faction's planets. These limits are at the discretion of the league administrator and once set for
            a season, will not change. The limits for a given league will be publicly posted as part of that league's specific rules.
        </div>

        <div>
            <span class="bold">Selling Resources</span>. Another form of income can be realized by selling faction resources, generally via
            the Black Market. Two forms of sale can occur -- direct sale, where the item(s) in question are typically sold at a discount
            ("need the cash now", in other words); and "consignment" sale, where it may be possible to realize a premium price for the
            item(s) but the time and date of sale may be in the future. This second option is the only way for units to sell to one
            another, and is monitored closely by league administration for patterns of abuse.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Expenses</h2>
        <div>
            The following table of jump costs is a base set of costs and may be changed on a per-league basis at any time by league
            administration. Additionally, a league designer or administrator may override these costs prior to the start of the league;
            in this case the custom values will be published in that league's specific ruleset.
        </div>

        <div>
            Unlike many governments in the real world, the faction governments in NBT may not run a deficit; in other words, factions
            may not spend "into the red" and wait for payday to make up the difference. Note that the league economy design does not
            prevent a faction from becoming "insolvent" -- incurring more costs per cycle than income in that cycle, and if a faction
            becomes insolvent, league administration may take steps to remedy the situation. What steps are involved will be decided on
            a case-by-case basis, but common remedies often include liquidating civilian and military assets to reduce the faction's
            cost burden to a sustainable level.
        </div>

        <div>
            Jump costs by jump type and jumpship class. These costs are assessed and collected at the time of the action. If
            insufficient funds are available to perform the jump, the entire jump will fail (in the case where multiple ships
            are jumping at the same time).

            <div>
                <a href="/glossary/resource">Resources</a> in NBT include anything that a faction may use to prosecute military
                campaigns, including the means of combat-unit production (<a href="/glossary/factory">factories</a>) and the
                industrial base necessary to fund it all. The following may be purchased and delivered to various parts of your space.
                Certain restrictions apply to each.

                <div>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="bold">Combat Units</span>. Cost and availability vary by item and type.
                            <a href="/rules/factories.html">Factory production</a> and <a href="#black-market">Black Market</a>
                            are the only avenues available for direct purchase of combat unit resources.
                        </li>
                        <li><span class="bold">Industry Upgrade</span>. 5-13 c-bills (inclusive, changes randomly per day) per c-bill
                            of industry upgrade. Can be applied to any owned planet, to a maximum limit of 500,000,000 c-bills output per planet.
                        </li>
                        <li><span class="bold">Jumpship Purchase</span>. The following factions have the ability to produce additional jumpships
                            at any of their factories (this list is based on canon):
                            <ul>
                                <li>House Steiner (Federated/Lyran Commonwealth/Lyran Alliance)</li>
                                <li>House Davion (Federated Commonwealth/Federated Suns)</li>
                                <li>House Marik (Free Worlds League)</li>
                                <li>House Kurita (Draconis Combine)</li>
                                <li>House Liao (Capellan Confederation)</li>
                                <li>Free Rasalhague Republic</li>
                                <li>Word Of Blake</li>
                                <li>Clan Diamond Shark</li>
                                <li>Clan Snow Raven</li>
                            </ul>
                            This ability belongs to the faction, not the factories, so taking a CSR factory, for example, does not transfer
                            the ability to manufacture jumpships to the capturing faction. Additionally, jumpships themselves may not
                            be captured by enemy forces. The following table outlines the costs for jumpship purchases:
                        </li>
                        <li><span class="bold">Dropship Purchase</span>. As dropships are not LosTech (as jumpships are), any faction
                            may produce dropships at any of their factories. Costs are based on capacity and certification (combat dropships,
                            for instance, will be more expensive than civilian merchant dropships) and will also fluctuate with the galactic
                            economy (as with everything else in NBT that has to be manufactured and can be purchased). Combat dropships can
                            be captured during hostile actions. The cost for all dropships for both Clan and Inner Sphere is as follows:
                        </li>
                        <li><span class="bold">Flagship Upgrade</span>. All factions have the ability to upgrade a combat jumpship to a
                            flagship at will. In order to qualify for upgrade, the jumpship to be converted
                            <ul>
                                <li>must have N hardpoints or be of X class</li>
                                <li>must be present at the faction capital</li>
                                <li>must not have any dropships docked to it.</li>
                            </ul>
                            The cost for upgrade is N c-bills per jumpship for Inner Sphere factions, and M c-bills per jumpship
                            for Clan factions.

            <h2>Black Market</h2>
            <div>
                The Black Market in NBT is exactly what it sounds like -- an "alternate procurement channel" for obtaining military
                hardware in which a faction may find itself in need. The contents of the Black Market follow the same supply-and-demand
                law that the above-board economy in NBT uses, but often at a steep premium for rare or desirable items (and a steep
                discount for "stuff no one wants"). The Black Market is stocked by sales of military hardware from the stores of the
                factions that make up the league, as well as the occasional addition from other, more mysterious sources.
            </div>

            <div>
                Black Market purchases can be delivered, instantly, to any planet
                    <ul>
                        <li>owned by the purchasing faction, or </li>
                        <li>where the purchasing faction has at least 10 combat units (of any type) in
                            <a href="/glossary/allied-garrison">Allied Garrison</a></li>

                    </ul>
                unless the planet is in full battle lockdown (Black Market purchases can be delivered to a planet under
                attack prior to full battle lockdown, however). If a purchase is made to be delivered to a planet not
                eligible for immmediate delivery, the purchaser may
                    <ul>
                        <li>cancel the purchase, or</li>
                        <li>schedule immediate delivery to an eligible planet, or</li>
                        <li>have the combat units delivered into mothball on the original planet of delivery</li>
                    </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Maintenance</h2>
            <div>
                Nothing takes care of itself; without regular maintenance, entropy dictates that your finely-tuned combat forces
                will rust and crumble under their own weight. As such, maintenance costs are deducted from your account with each
                income cycle. The actual costs will vary by league and by type of combat unit or jumpship/dropship.
                Additional costs are incurred per planet and charge station in your space, for the same reasons.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Transferring Money</h2>
            <div>
                Money may be transferred between factions (including those not allied with each other) at any time, for any reason.
                NBT Administration is notified of each of these transfers and if they are not on the up-and-up, may initiate an
                investigation into the transfer (potentially reversing it if it is deemed unsuitable). A fee is charged for all
                transfers, on a scale related directly to the alliance level between the two factions involved. See
                <a href="/rules/alliances.html">Alliances, Diplomacy and Espionage</a> for more details on the mechanics of
                faction alliances.
