        While the mechanics of a resource-based planetary league can, on their own, provide additional meaning to the
        game being played, the interactions between the factions and the teams within the league are what provide the
        real depth in any NBT league. Otherwise, you may as well just be playing against the computer.
    </div>
    <div class="nbt-rules-para">
        In NBT, this interaction is enhanced by the formation (or dissolution) of alliances between factions, and ongoing
        diplomacy (and occasional underhandedness) between the factions in the league. While the basic details of alliances
        between factions are public knowledge, schemes, strategies and machinations are not -- and that is where any
        NBT league gains an added immersive dimension.

        <h2 class="nbt-h2">Alliance Levels</h2>
        <div class="nbt-rules-para">
            The level of diplomatic relations (or lack thereof) between factions is public knowledge, and is codified
            in a simple system: positive diplomacy levels indicate an alliance, and negative levels indicate hostility.
            A diplomacy level of zero (0) indicates neutrality and is where everyone in an NBT league begins. Greater
            magnitude of non-zero diplomacy levels indicate stronger alliances, or greater hostility, depending on whether
            the level is positive or negative, respectively.
        </div>
        <div class="nbt-rules-para">
            Since all factions start neutral with one another, it takes a nudge in one direction or the other to tip
            the relationship off the fence. Perhaps a faction requests safe passage through a system controlled by a
            neutrally-aligned neighbor; if the neighbor agrees, the relationship between the two begins to warm and
            the factions begin a positive diplomatic relationship with one another. Or perhaps that first faction decides
            they want to go take some of the neutral neighbor's resources; this will begin a decline in diplomatic relations.
        </div>
        <div class="nbt-rules-para">
            In either case, hostile actions will cause a negative effect on diplomatic relations, and friendly actions will
            cause a positive effect. In this way, factions can form their own alliances (or not), and it will require
            ongoing work on the part of the factions involved to nurture an alliance, or maintain a grievance. Two factions
            can also heal a broken diplomatic relationship by beginning to work together in ways that push their
            diplomacy level in a positive direction.
        </div>
        <div class="nbt-rules-para">
            Alliance levels do have a maximum (for allies) and minimum (for enemies); relations between two factions cannot
            continue growing or deteriorating forever. The maximum and minimum alliance levels between factions is set on
            a per-league basis and can be found in the per-league rules.
        </div>
        <div class="nbt-rules-para">
            Alliance levels are more than just a number; they also dictate in which ways two factions might interact in
            the league, enforced by the league automation. For instance, one faction may not purchase resources from another
            faction unless their alliance level is at or greater than a certain positive level. Or, one faction might not
            be able to launch a Sector Assault on another unless the level of diplomacy between the two is sufficiently
            poor. The levels at which certain acts are allowed is defined on a per-league basis and is documented in the
            rules for your particular league.

        <h2 class="nbt-h2">Espionage And Counter-Intelligence</h2>
        <div class="nbt-rules-para">
            As described on the page defining the rules for <a href="battles.html">Sector Raids</a>, one of the effects
            possible from a raid is spies ("espionage"), for attackers, and counter-intelligence for defenders.
        </div>
        <div class="nbt-rules-para">
            One of the central goals of the NBT economic and military environment is the notion of "scarcity": industry
            should be considered and invested carefully, and military campaigns should be executed wisely, and one way
            to ensure this is to make money and guns scarce -- wantonly spending ones military and economic might should
            result in adverse outcomes. But it is not possible to police this unilaterally, however, "on the honor system",
            as it were -- someone should be watching.
        </div>
        <div class="nbt-rules-para">
            One of the ways to keep factions honest, in terms of how they deploy their resources and prosecute their
            military campaigns, is if neighboring and enemy factions can keep track of what you are doing (at various
            levels of detail and accuracy, of course). For example, scarcity should dictate that it's not feasible to
            leave part of one's space essentially undefended, in order to put into motion an aggressive offensive campaign,
            but that only works if someone else knows that your space is undefended, and can take advantage of that. This
            is where professional spy networks enter the picture.
        </div>
        <div class="nbt-rules-para">
            In NBT, attacking factions will have the opportunity, as part of a Sector Raid, to place spies in an enemy
            sector. These spies can detect and report on economic activity (industrial investment, for example) in the
            sector, on troop movements and garrison levels in the sector, on political events in the sector, and so on.
            Depending on the "experience" level of the spy, and the area(s) they are monitoring, the sponsoring faction
            can gain a wealth of ongoing intel on the enemy's activities, and plan accordingly (or, distribute the intel
            to allies, or to neutral factions as part of opening friendly diplomatic relations).
        </div>
        <div class="nbt-rules-para">
            But one should not assume that the target faction is simply letting this happen; factions are also able to
            spend resources on counter-intelligence, either as part of effect credits earned during a Sector Raid
            defense, or as part of ongoing counter-espionage efforts funded by their income. These efforts have the effect
            of reducing the effectiveness and accuracy of your spies; in some cases, your spies may receive and pass on
            incorrect information, and you will need to spend time and effort correlating their intel to identify the
            truth. In extreme cases, counter-espionage efforts can root out and destroy your spies entirely, leaving you
            completely in the dark about enemy actions within a sector.

            <h3 class="nbt-h3">Spy Areas Of Focus</h3>
            <div class="nbt-rules-para">
                Each spy placed will focus on a single general area to monitor and report -- economic, military or
                political. They will not report on activity outside their area of focus. This area is set when the spy
                is placed and cannot subsequently be changed.

            <h3 class="nbt-h3">Spy Skill Levels</h3>
            <div class="nbt-rules-para">
                Each spy has a skill level, on a scale of 1-5. This level is determined when the spy is placed in the
                enemy space (during the Sector Raid), and cannot subsequently increase. Each skill level corresponds to
                a different level of efficiency and accuracy:
                <ol class="nbt-ordered-list">
                    <li><span class="highlight">Level 1:</span> 35% chance of detecting activity in their area of focus;
                        50% quantitative error in their reports.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Level 2:</span> 50% chance of detecting activity in their area of focus;
                        25% quantitative error in their reports.

                    <li><span class="highlight">Level 3:</span> 70% chance of detecting activity in their area of focus;
                        25% quantitative error in their reports.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Level 4:</span> 90% chance of detecting activity in their area of focus;
                        10% quantitative error in their reports.

                    <li><span class="highlight">Level 5:</span> 100% chance of detecting activity in their area of focus;
                        0% quantitative error in their reports.

                </ol>
                Consult the <a href="battles.html">Sector Raids</a> rules for more on how a spy's skill level is set.
            </div>

            <h3 class="nbt-h3">Spies And Counter-Espionage</h3>
            <div class="nbt-rules-para">
                The defending faction in a Sector Raid has the opportunity to offset the skill of any spies placed during
                a Sector Raid; for details, consult the <a href="battles.html">Sector Raids</a> rules. In general, this
                offset reduces the skill level of spies placed (if any), at that time only.
            </div>
            <div class="nbt-rules-para">
                Additionally, a faction may spend c-bills on counter-intelligence efforts, on an ongoing basis. This will
                have the effect, over time, of reducing a spy's skill level. This spending affects all spies in a faction's
                sector at once, so the more spies in the sector, the less the reduction effect per c-bill spent. The
                exact amount of spending required to reduce a spy's skill by one full level is determined on a per-league
                basis, and the rules for that league should be consulted for those amounts.
            </div>
            <div class="nbt-rules-para">
                If a spy's skill level is reduced to zero (0), the spy is considered destroyed (or, at least, discovered
                and ejected from the sector); either way, that spy no longer is present in the sector and cannot make
                any reports from the sector thereafter.
