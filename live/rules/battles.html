        <div class="nbt-rules-para">
            NBT supports two battle types -- Sector Raid and Sector Assault. Sector Raids are launched for many reasons
            and can result in many different effects, but ownership of a sector does not change hands as a result. Sector
            Assaults are launched in order to take ownership of a sector from the defending faction.

            <li>
                <span class="highlight">Allied Defender:</span> One or more factions participating on the defending side
                of a Sector Assault (allied operations are only valid in Sector Assaults). These factions are optional
                participants in the battle.

            In all cases, factions are restricted to using only the combat units they bring to the battle; combat units
            may not be "shared" among allied factions in a Sector Assault, nor can combat units in Allied Garrison be used
            by the sector owner during a Sector Raid or Sector Assault. Allied attacks or defenses must involve actual
            physical participation by the allied factions. In order to qualify for "allied faction" status in a given
            battle, at least ten (10) combat units owned by the allied faction must be present in the battle (typically
            provided during the Reinforce phase of the battle).

        <div class="nbt-rules-para">
            For the purposes of scheduling, logging and inter-faction communication, battles are controlled by the primary
            defender and attacker for the duration of the battle; battles may not be "transferred" between allies in a
            Sector Assault.

            <span class="highlight">Launching A Battle:</span> Battles are launched as described on the <a href="/rules/transport.html">Jumpships, Dropships and Travel</a> page,
            by performing a Normal jump into enemy space with the required equipment (i.e. Flagship for a Sector Assault, etc.).
        </div>
        <div class="nbt-rules-para">
            <span class="highlight">Battle Reinforcement:</span> Once a battle has been launched, the battle enters the "Reinforce" phase, where defenders and attackers (including allies
            in Sector Assaults) may augment the sector's defenses (or the attacking forces) by dropping additional dropships
            from jumpships in the system. This process is one-way -- combat units may arrive via dropship, but may not
            leave the planet on which they are present, once unloaded from their dropships. Dropships themselves may
            come and go, and are not required to stay around for the duration of the battle. The Reinforce phase lasts
            18 hours after the battle is launched, subject to per-league overrides. Additionally, the primary factions
            in the battle may mutally agree to end the Reinforce period at any time during this phase and enter the
            Forcedec phase. Otherwise, the two primary factions must agree on a mutually-acceptable time and date to
            fight the battle in the league's game or simulator.
        </div>
        <div class="nbt-rules-para">
            <span class="highlight">Battle Forcedec:</span> Once the Reinforce phase ends, the NBT automation will generate
            a "force declaration", or "forcedec". This marks the beginning of the Forcedec phase of the battle, and no
            more reinforcements will be allowed. The forcedec contains a list of the combat units initially available to
            each faction involved in the battle (factions can only see their own combat units), as well as the conditions
            of the battle (the list of maps, tonnage/battle-value restrictions, drop conditions, etc.) and publicly-
            available battle data (the primary factions involved, the attack date, the sector involved, the battle ID, etc.).
            This data is emailed to each member of the teams involved in the battle, who have been marked in the faction's
            roster as interested in this data, assuming that those individuals have opted into such emails. The forcedec
            is also available in the faction automation for view by anyone with access (see
            <a href="/rules/sector-assault">Sector Assaults</a> for additional information about Sector Assault forcedecs).
            If the primary factions agree to end the Reinforce phase early, the forcedec is generated and emailed at that time.

                        defender lost control of the sector, they are given the opportunity to offload any remaining
                        combat forces onto dropships; if no dropships are available and none can be jumped into the sector
                        in a timely fashion, the defender will forfeit all remaining forces in the sector to the attacker.

                    faction in question to continue in the league, but carry on with some battles rather than going fully
                    inactive.  Defensive Limits for Semi-Active status is 1 defensive slot.
                    This is a temporary setting only, to give factions time to get their affairs in order, and then

                        fight all their offensive and defensive battles within league time limits.  Defensive battles for Active
                        units are based on the size of the faction (in terms of number of planets controlled) and the number
                        of pending offensive battles they have launched. The base defend limits are:

                        actual number of active defends is equal to the number of active attacks a faction has launched,
                        with the above numbers as a minimum. So a small faction with fewer than 70 planets can have two
                        defend slots open if they have two attacks in progress at once.

            Raids on an enemy sector are intended to model multiple simultaneous actions within the sector. As such, all
            drops in a raid are played, as from a "lore" perspective, success is not known until the whole action is complete.
            Additionally, once a combat unit is used, it is not available for subsequent drops in the raid. For example, if you
            bring 8 of Unit X to the raid and use 5 Unit X on the first drop, you will only have 3 Unit X available to
            subsequent drops. This is regardless of whether or not those units were destroyed. This models the fact that
            the raid is happening all at the same time throughout the sector.

            A faction may initiate a raid on a neighboring enemy sector for the purpose of inflicting various sorts of

            warfare" on the enemy. Raids do not result in the transfer of enemy planets or sectors, however.

                            See <a href="/rules/diplomacy.html">Diplomacy</a> for more specifics. Credits can be spent on any
                            combination of spy count and effectiveness; for instance, the victor in a sector raid may spend
                            5 credits on a single spy to watch military movements, and 3 on 3 different "novice" spies to
                            watch other aspects of sector life. Or they may spend 8 credits on 4 2-credit spies and sift through
                            the reported data themselves to correlate accuracy. Spy effectiveness is on a scale of 1-8, in terms of credits,
                            and can only be set when the spy is placed in the sector.

                            Spies can use the sector's communications networks and surveillance tactics to monitor military, economic
                            and political activity in the sector, and report back to the sponsoring faction on activities in the
                            sector such as troop/equipment movements, jumpship activity, industrial investment, and so on. The quality
                            and effectiveness of the spy(s) placed depend on the amount of credits spent on them; a single spy
                            worth ten credits will be able to provide detailed and accurate information on a single aspect of
                            the sector's activity (for instance, military manuevers), but not other aspects such as economy and
                            politics. More spies of lesser quality will be subject to greater chance of missing activity or
                            possibly being fed misinformation; remember, the sector owner is likely spending funds on
                            counter-espionage as well and those efforts will impact the effectiveness of your spies.

                            factory disruption or damage. 1 defender credit per attacker credit offset. For example, if
                            the credit differential at the end of the raid is +3 in favor of the attacker, the defender
                            can spend 4 credits to reduce the attacker's level of detail as if the differential were negative.
                            This depends on the attacker choosing to perform a theft, disruption or destruction. This is
                            "game theory" in action.

                        <li><span class="highlight">Counter-Intelligence:</span> Similar to how a defender can offset an
                            attackers theft, disruption or destruction effectiveness with Enhanced Security, the defender
                            can reduce the effectiveness of spies placed in their space by spending credits on counter-
                            intelligence. The number of credits spent reduces the effectiveness of enemy spies, from the
                            least effective to the most effective, by reducing their effective attacker credit spend by
                            the number of credits the defender spends. For instance, if the attacker spends 8 credits to
                            place one 5-credit, one 2-credit and one 1-credit spy, the defender can spend, say, 3 Counter-
                            Intelligence credits to reduce the 2-credit spy to a 1-credit spy and the 5-credit spy to a
                            3-credit spy. Again, this depends on the attacker spending credits on spies (game theory again),
                            and if the attacker does not spend anything on spies, the Counter-Intelligence credits are lost.

                            the chance or the length of time that the sector will enter political instability, if the
                            attacker chose to spend credits on Political Instability. The offset is 1 attacker credit
                            per defender credit, and will offset attacker credits spent on duration (all the way to zero)
                            before they offset attacker credits spendt on chance of instability (again, all the way to zero).

                            ability for an opponent to launch a Sector Assault on the sector. Each credit is worth one (1)
                            day worth of immunity from raids (from the date and time the current raid was logged). This
                            allows factions the opportunity to prevent sectors from being in a permanent state of lockdown.

            loses control of a sector in a Sector Assault retains the right to "counter-attack" with their own Sector
            Assault, on the sector they just lost, for a period of 30 days after the logging of the battle is complete.
            This MUST involve only the two primary factions from the Sector Assault (albeit now in reversed roles). These

            at all (no garrisons are present) or fails to do so by oversight, the attacker is awarded the maximum number
            of credits per drop for the sector (3 per drop). Note that the typical play in this situation would be for the attacker to
            ensure political instability for the sector, followed immediately by a Sector Assault (which would also be won in
            No-Garrison fashion, since political instability eliminates the opportunity for the defender to reinforce), so
            factions should be careful about leaving bits of their space undefended, especially if an enemy faction might
            have introduced spies into their sector(s) who can alert their factions to such a situation.
