        Welcome to NBT! If you are reading this, it is probably because you are interested in joining NBT. For a brief
        explanation of what NBT offers to the player of a BattleTech-based game, you may first want to review the
        <a href="#" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#nbt-rules-intro">NBT Overview</a>. When finished (or if you are
        already familiar with NBT), the basic rules for participation in NBT follow.
    </div>

    <div class="nbt-rules-para">
        <span class="highlight">Do I need to be on a team to play in NBT?</span>&nbsp;Whether an NBT league instance is team-
        or individual-based depends on the underlying game. For example, a multi-player Mechwarrior-based
        league will be strictly team-based (no solo or lone-wolf pilots are supported). However, a player-vs-player turn-based game such as
        Battletech or MegaMek is inherently single-player by design, and as such, an NBT league based on these games would support individual
        ownership and control of factions (although the team-based architecture of NBT faction control would allow multiple players to play out
        battles on behalf of the faction).

    <h2 class="nbt-h2">NBT Code Of Conduct</h2>

    <div class="nbt-rules-para">
        The following base set of rules apply to all players in all NBT leagues, regardless of rank, popularity, success, etc. No one is above these rules
        and verified violation of these rules will result in immediate punitive action by league administration once brought to their attention.
        The primary goal of NBT is to have fun playing the game, and violation of each of the following runs counter to that goal.
        One way to view these rules, is that they are expected of any adult in civil society; a certain level of maturity is required and
        expected from participants in an NBT league.
    </div>

    <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">The Rules:</span>&nbsp;You will not taunt or otherwise encourage other players to violate any NBT or game rules.
            You will not allow another player to taunt you into violating any NBT or game rules.
            NBT Rules are to be upheld at all times, by all members.
        </li>

        <li>
            <span class="highlight">Cheating:</span>&nbsp;Cheating in ALL forms is strictly forbidden.  In the game, in the automation, in comms, wherever it may occur.
            Any player found intentionally cheating will be banned from all NBT leagues.
            This includes exploiting any bugs in the game itself to obtain an unfair advantage over your opponents.
            If you have a question about whether or not a particular game mechanic is a bug, ask your league administration;
            they will make a binding ruling and update the public rules accordingly.
        </li>

        <li>
            <span class="highlight">Accusations Of Cheating:</span>&nbsp;Should you feel that someone is cheating, you MUST have proof. This is the day and age of pervasive streaming and the ability
            easily to record your matches in full; there is no reason not to have conclusive proof of suspicious activity. You should also understand
            that the accused will have a chance to offer evidence (likely video, from their perspective) to counter the accusation, and all available
            evidence will be considered by league administration.
            Once you have conclusive evidence, you will contact NBT Administration with same; accusations of cheating will NOT be prosecuted in public,
            which means no posting same in any forums, mailing lists, chat clients, in-game, anywhere.
            NBT Administration will then make a determination on the nature of the proof, and what action will be taken -- if any. Understand that
            accusations of cheating, as much as they damage the enjoyment of the game for the victim, can also irreparably damage the reputation
            of the accused if they are false or in any way fabricated. Therefore, the decisions of NBT Administration are final on the accusation
            leveled. The presence of any such decision (regardless in whose favor the decision swings) does not lift the prohibition on prosecuting the accusation in public; given the serious nature
            of accusations of cheating, violating this rule will result in sanctions as swiftly as any levied against the alleged cheater. In short,
            don't do it.
        </li>

        <li>
            <span class="highlight">Cursing & Offensive Remarks:</span>&nbsp;You may not use any offensive, sexually explicit, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene,
            hateful, racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable remarks. Understand that some terms that are commonly accepted in certain
            cultures, regions or nations may not be acceptable in others, so be cautious in public text or voice communications.
            You will not use partial masking in order to use inappropriate words that would otherwise be in violation of the rules.
            [Note: If we can tell what word you are trying to mask, and the word is in violation of the rules, then the partially masked
            word is in violation of the rules. Hint: Try using cartoon speak when you really want to say something potentially offensive.
            "I am &^%^$% lost!" is an example of complete masking and is acceptable.]
        </li>

        <li>
            <span class="highlight">Gloating, Taunting, Whining & Pouting:</span>&nbsp;This is a game; in each match and drop, one player or team will win, the other will lose.
            Winners are supposed to be proud of their accomplishments, but not to the detriment of the members and morale of the opponent.
            On the other hand, when a battle is lost there is no excuse for stalking off or sulking as a result.
            Learn from your mistakes and move on. Let the other team know it was a "Good Game" and continue playing (even if it was not;
            the essential niceties must be observed).
            Basically this comes down to a certain level of maturity on the part of the members of the league. Win with class, lose with dignity.
            Note that there is a difference (subtle, but there) between friendly trash-talking and griefing; as always, NBT
            Administration will have the final say on whether or not an exchange crosses the line. Basically, err on the side of saying nothing;
            if it doesn't need to be said, ]don't say it -- always assume that someone will have a screenshot, video, or audio recording of
            what you said and NBT Administration will make a decision solely on that basis.
        </li>

        <li>
            <span class="highlight">Attitudes & Egos:</span>&nbsp;These will not be tolerated in NBT. Each of us is here to have fun.  People with massive egos, chips on their shoulders,
            or just bad attitudes are a waste of the NBT Administrators' time as well as that of other teams. If you are not here to
            have fun, and allow others to do the same, you are in the wrong place, and need to move on. Judgement on the toxicity of any
            given player or team is solely at the discretion of NBT Administration.
        </li>

        <li>
            <span class="highlight">Legal:</span>&nbsp;You may not violate any local, state, national or international law or regulation while playing in an NBT-related match or drop.
            You may not use the game service to engage in illegal activity. You may not arrange for the exchange or transfer of any
            pirated software or other contraband while you are in the NBT automation or through the NBT website or forums.
            You may not use the NBT Website for activities other than activities permitted in the game universe or events associated with NBT.
        </li>

        <li>
            <span class="highlight">Rules Lawyering:</span>&nbsp;Your idea of fun may be trying to nitpick every possible violation of the NBT League Rules by
            your opponents. That is not NBT Administration's idea of fun. Rules lawyers are boring; don't be one. Consider infractions
            on the basis of their severity and intent and make sure you want to bring them to the attention of NBT Administration. If
            you are a player who habitually brings up violations of any severity or intent, NBT Administration will quickly tune you
            out. In other words, make sure the infraction actually matters.
