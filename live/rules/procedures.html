        In order to ensure the smooth operation of any NBT league, battle procedures and protocols have been established that
        all factions involved are expected to follow. Failure to do so, and to rectify to the satisfaction of both teams
        involved in executing a battle, and requiring admin involvement, will generally result in punitive actions such
        as forfeit or other adversarial actions on the part of league admin in favor of the plaintiff. Short version:
        follow the procedures and the rules, adhere to the time requirements for scheduling and logging battles, and
        everyone goes away happy.

                    Your command staff will receive a forces declaration ("forcedec") from the automation, stating all
                    of the battle particulars, including battle ID, combat units on planet, opponent, maps to be used,
                    environment settings, and so on. At the same time, you will see a new alert in your faction automation
                    interface, notifying you of the forcedec issuance. You will schedule a date and time to fight the whole
                    battle (in the case of Sector Raids) or to begin the battle (in the case of Sector Assaults) using
                    the faction automation -- this is the official record of communication between the two factions, and
                    will be the only source of communication considered when determining forfeits. All scheduling should be
                    handled through the faction administration interface.

                    <ul class="nbt-unordered-list">
                        <li>After a forcedec has been issued, the factions involved have 72 hours to complete arrangements to

                        <li>Both teams are responsible for establishing contact and scheduling the battle; it is not incumbent
                            upon the attacker, for example, to make initial contact -- the defender can just as easily open
                            the lines of communication. A date and time should be agreed upon with 72 hours of issuance
                            of the forcedec. Failure will result in the battle being forfieted by the delaying party.
                            The sooner both parties respond, the sooner their schedules can be determined and the battles be fought.
                        </li>

                    in a single night. However, a minimum time investment is expected for the parties involved in a
                    Sector Assault. Please plan on at least 2 hours or 5 drops (whichever results in the greater number
                    of drops completed in a night) when scheduling. Additionally, it may be easier for both teams to have
                    a set night per week on which the assault can be fought until it is completed. It is expected that
                    Sector Raids will be completed in a single night.

                    <span class="highlight">Differing Time Zones:</span> NBT Adminstration will do its best to prevent
                    major timezone conflicts when populating factions with teams; this could mean setting up the map such
                    that neightboring factions are controlled by teams in the same timezone, or by suggesting dual-ownership
                    of a faction by teams from different geos, and so on. However, the schedules of two teams may still
                    not match exactly (especially across geos, for instance a North American team against an Oceanic/Asia-Pacific
                    team). In such cases, the "Give & Take" concept applies. The first week should be fought in the
                    Defender's time frame, with the following week in the Attacker's time frame, alternating back and
                    forth until the battle is completed. This does mean at the other team's time frame, not just an hour
                    outside of ones own normal schedule. Standard US time is 2100-2200 (EST) on any night, and standard
                    Euro time is 1500-1600 EST on the weekends. This concept may also apply when factions fight multiple
                    series of raids over the course of the league.

                <div class="nbt-rules-para">
                    Another option is to involve allies to fulfill those alternate times that may be hard for your team to meet.
                    Regardless of who is fighting a battle though, the give and take should continue throughout, and the
                    initial agreed upon time should be stuck to each week or alt week. This is an area will it will
                    require two teams to work together to get the battle accomplished. If you cannot work with the other
                    team to complete a battle in this method, then you will need to look at merging with another unit,
                    as you are not meeting the minimum requirements to maintain a faction within the league.

                <div class="nbt-rules-para">
                    While NBT Admin cannot require that teams follow certain procedures internally, we do require that
                    the drop night go as smoothly as possible. This means preparing for your drop night in advance of
                    the scheduled battle time. It's often just a matter of courtesy to your team and your opponent. Some
                    common-sense suggestions include:
                    <ul class="nbt-unordered-list">
                        <li>Practice and combat unit customization (i.e. "Mechlab") must be done PRIOR TO the scheduled
                            time. In the lobby is not the time to be making new configs.
                        </li>
                        <li>Inform your team of the agreed upon battle time, requesting their presence.  We suggest
                            that they show up at least 10 minutes early.
                        </li>
                        <li>Games launch ON TIME. If your battle is scheduled at 9:00, then the game should begin at
                            9:00; players should not start arriving at 9:00.
                        </li>
                        <li>You have time to prepare for your battle drops -- the forcedec is typically issued days in
                            advance of the scheduled drop time; use that time to prepare your configs and your strategies
                            and tactics. Know which players will be rotating in and out and which combat units they are
                            likely to need, and their configs. Again, the time for that is long before you get into the
                            game lobby.

            <h2 class="nbt-h2">Pilot Requirements</h2>
            <div class="nbt-rules-para">
                Each team should be able to provide the minimum number of pilots for each drop from their own rosters.
                We do understand though that occasionally things happen (real life mostly).  As such, each team is
                allowed to make use of allied pilots to round out its drop team, with the following guidelines:
                <ul class="nbt-unordered-list">
                    <li>All allied factions may substitute no more than 2 pilots in any particular battle.</li>
                    <li>Factions with allied garrison present on planet may drop from 0% to 100%. Pilots playing on the
                        allied garrison rule must use their own combat units, as long as they have 10
                        combat units remaining. After that, they become a normal allied unit (for purposes of pilot sharing).
                    </li>
                    <li>General Rule (Offensive & Defensive) - max of 2 allied pilots per drop. Remaining pilots must
                        be of the primary unit.</li>
                    <li>Exception - clans at alliance level greater than 25 may share up to 4 allied pilots per drop,
                        regardless of allied garrison.</li>
                    <li>Mercenaries are never considered employers of one another for the purposes of allied pilots.</li>
                    <li>All of the above are rendered null and void if allied garrison or allied attack combat units are
                        present in the battle. The allied units may then provide unlimited pilot so long as they have
                        combat units left to pilot.
                    </li>
                    <li>All pilots on an NBT roster must use their full in-game name, including any team or unit tags
                        provided/managed by the game.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                Regardless of the sharing of pilots, these rules should not be abused in such a way to bring in
                "ringers" or similar. These rules are in place so that units may handle their battles in a timely manner,
                allowing both sides to get as much combat time as they wish, while enjoying the experience.

            for any questions you have or issues that need addressed. One or more representatives, with the authority to
            speak on behalf of your team, should be in one or both of these services prior to drop time (preferably at

        <div class="nbt-rules-para">
            At least 5 minutes prior to drop time, a server or (private) lobby instance should be created for the drops, with the
            conditions as prescribed on the forcedec (or by the multi-drop tracker for multi-drop battles) for the
            first drop of the night. The defender will host the server or create the lobby instance, and when a choice
            is available, will take Team 1 or Team A (as applicable). In games where teams are organized instead by spawn
            point, the defender will have choice of spawn point, followed by the attacker. The teams should be assembled
            in the server, with spawn points chosen, and everyone "Ready", at the scheduled drop time. A 10-minute grace
            period is available for persistent connection issues, but should not be abused -- if the scheduled start is
            9:00, this does not mean "it's really 9:10". If one team is having unforeseen issues with pilots or availability,
            they should communicate this to the opponent and both teams can determine the reasonable course of action
            (including a reschedule if necessary). If an insufficient number of pilots is available, 1 reschedule is
            allowed (no last-minute reschedules unless the opponent agrees). If an insufficient number of pilots shows up
            at the rescheduled time, the battle is forfeit. No-shows (with no communication) are automatically awarded
            to the opponent as forfeit, unless the opponent wishes to reschedule.

            Games or game clients behave differently from one another; for games or clients where there is a chance of
            disconnection on launch, NBT will be considered a "No Hot Drop" league, meaning that both teams must
            verify that all of their pilots are in the game and ready before anyone on either team moves from their
            spawn. For games or clients where connection to the lobby implies connection to the game, hot-drop will be
            allowed. For no-hot-drop games, each opposing drop commander must call "GO" in open/global text chat, at which
            time the teams may proceed with the drop.

            For no-hot-drop games, or for hot-drop games where disconnect on launch is possible, "GO" must be called within

        <div class="nbt-rules-para">
            Please make sure that all pilots are aware of the following rules as to conduct in the game itself:

                <li>Pilots may not use defects in the game, such as parts of terrain that "disappear" from a certain angle,
                    to watch for the opposing team to approach -- this is akin to using a "wallhack" and is not tolerated.

                    with no intention of fighting". This is different from, say, "taking up a defensive position with
                    weapon choices to match", and NBT Admin knows the difference. We tire of hearing this accusation.
                    In modern times, however, anyone can stream and virtually everyone has an easy way to record video
                    of a match, and video evidence is king when it comes to camping accusations. You will find that NBT
                    Admin will rarely decides in favor of the accuser in these cases.
                </li>
                <li>All pilots will remain in the game until it is over. Some games will exhibit significant lag spikes or
                    warping when a pilot disconnects.
                </li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Ping Problems:</span> If a particular pilot has a consistent ping of over

                    were just taken. This is known as your "Drop Declaration" (dropdec).  This dropdec must be 100%
                    correct, under penalty of forfeit. Most games provide a post-match summary screen -- take a screenshot

                    have taken screenshots that show the drop results (although it makes good sense to do so); remain
                    around until the night's logging is completed on both sides (and attackers, please note that you have

            and easy.  There is no excuse for delaying.  Once completed with the battles and reporting, both Battle
            Commanders may disconnect and go their own way.
