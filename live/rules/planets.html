        <div class="nbt-rules-para">
            Each faction's space is comprised of planets, which are further divided into "sectors". Combat in NBT happens
            at the sector level; whether the action is a Sector Raid or Sector Assault, it happens for all planets in the
            sector at once. For Sector Assaults, the victor gains (or retains) control of the entire sector.
        </div>

        <div class="nbt-rules-para">
            The number of planets a faction controls determines the range of the number of planets per sector in their space.
            This further impacts the scale of the battles involving those sectors.

            The reason that smaller factions have fewer drops per raid is to keep their activity levels within reasonable
            limits for their size; it is assumed that smaller factions are controlled by smaller teams with a lower sustained
            activity level.

        <h2 class="nbt-h2">Industry</h2>
        <div class="nbt-rules-para">
            Each planet in a faction's space can produce c-bills for the faction. During faction setup, a team will be
            given a certain amount of industry it must place around the faction's space. To speed up faction setup, the
            majority of that industry will be automatically placed for the faction when the team acquires the keys to
            the faction; this industry cannot be reduced during setup. The remainder is placed manually by the team, and
            can be used to augment the automatically-placed industry.
        </div>
        <div class="nbt-rules-para">
            The maximum number of combat units allowed in a sector is governed by the amount of industry in the sector;
            this is to keep defense levels commensurate with sector worth -- the greater the industry level, the greater
            the number of combat units can be employed to defend that industry.
        </div>
        <div class="nbt-rules-para">
            Additionally, for sectors containing factories, the level of industry affects the delivery time of combat assets
            produced at those factories. This models the "network effect" in the economy -- if delivery time is to be
            reduced for units in high demand, then investment must be made in the supply chain for those units. For example,
            if a particular Battlemech is extremely popular, and only one supplier is making lower-leg actuator assemblies,
            then production on that Battlemech will necessarily be slow, unless new suppliers are created or the existing
            supplier's capacity is expanded. Both of these actions are modeled by aggregate investment in industry.
        </div>
        <div class="nbt-rules-para">
            Industry may be increased on any planet, up to 500 million c-bills. The cost of industry increases will fluctuate
            daily on as random basis, and will be in the range of 5-13 c-bills per c-bill of industrial output. Industry
            is purchased on a planetary basis, and the investment cost will be debited to the faction's account at the time
            of investment (not at the time of delivery). The additional industrial output will take effect at the next
            income disbursement cycle, but no sooner than 3 days after the investment is made. Since "payday" in NBT is
            Sunday 23:59:00 UTC, in order for industry investment to take effect with the next payday following the investment,
            it must be purchased no later than Thursday, 23:58:59 UTC.

            Each of your planets is a living, breathing thing. Occasionally they go through economy problems, or maybe
            a diamond mine is discovered, boosting the economy.  As such, during the course of the league you will
            notice that many of your planets industry levels will vary from month to month.  This variation will be
            small in the grand scheme of things (up to a 25 million change, up or down) but taken together can cause a
            modest impact upon the league and your strategies.

            As detailed in the section on Sector Raids, one or more planets in a sector may go into what is known as

            planet or in the sector. Political Instability continues for 30 days after inception, and will clear up on its
            own if left to its own devices. A faction may also choose to correct the situation by suitable infusion of
            funds (defined as "50% of the planet's industry level") at the 20-day mark. This is performed on a per-planet
            basis. The negative effects of Political Instability include:

                    a 10% industry destruction, no matter the level of over-garrison. Attackers that damage the industry on a
                    successful SA will be auto-charged to repair the damaged industry at the industry prices current at the time

            Every planet can support both owned and allied garrison forces. In order for an ally to place a garrison on one

            for details). Allied Garrison is counted towards the combat unit count when considering over-garrison penalties. A
            planet may have garrisons from one or more allies on any given planet. In order for an ally to participate in any
            battle on the planet, or have Black Market mechs delivered to the planet, they must have at least ten (10) combat
