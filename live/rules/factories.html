        Anything that may be purchased (aside from industry) by a faction, is handled at a factory location.
        Factories are set up for a faction by the league designer and/or administrator,
        generally following BTU canon but deviating where necessary to achieve
        league balance and "fun". Purchases may be made at any owned factory, and any factory owned by a faction with
        whom the purchasing faction has at least a pre-determined level of alliance. (See
        <a href="/rules/alliances.html">Alliances, Diplomacy and Espionage</a> for more on the mechanics of alliances). The
        sole exception to this rule is that pirates may purchase from any un-owned factory on the starmap.

        <h2 class="nbt-h2">Factory Output And Prices</h2>
        <div class="nbt-rules-para">
            The NBT economy is intended to mimic, as closely as possible, the economy in the "real world" when it comes to
            supply-and-demand and the "network effects" they have not only on the sale prices of final production output, but
            also the availability itself. For instance, if an auto manufacturer produced a vehicle that everyone on Terra wanted
            to buy, the demand would far outstrip the supply, not only of the factory production stock, but also of the raw materials
            necessary to make the vehicle. The same applies to combat units in NBT; the more intensely popular a particular
            combat unit is, the more expensive it will be to purchase, and the longer it will take for them to be produced and
            delivered. Therefore, it is not possible to set a scale of prices (or delivery period) for any particular combat
            unit, as market forces will dictate these on a real-time basis in NBT.
        </div>

        <div class="nbt-rules-para">
            In BTU, many combat units have a "chassis" that is further classified by "variant" and "class". In NBT, there are
            three different ways to restrict factory output:
            <ul class="nbt-unordered-list">
                <li><span class="bold">By Class</span>. Factories can produce and sell all chassis and variants in a given class (for
                    example, "Assault 'Mech" factories can produce any 'Mech that qualifies as "Assault").
                </li>
                <li><span class="bold">By Chassis</span>. Factories can produce and sell all variants of a given chassis (for
                    example, "Awesome 'Mech" factories can produce any Awesome, such as AWS-8R, AWS-8Q, AWS-8T, and so on).
                </li>
                <li><span class="bold">By Variant</span>. The most restrictive option; factories can only produce and sell
                    the variant "on the door" (for example, "Awesome AWS-8Q" factories can only produce the AWS-8Q).
                </li>
            </ul>
            The type of factory production used by a given league is determined by the league designer and/or administrator, and is
            constant throughout that league.
        </div>

        <div class="nbt-rules-para">
            For the first two factory types, the league designer/adminstration may decide to allow (possibly substantial) discounts
            on the factory's "prime" variant (in a chassis-based factory system) or "prime" chassis (in a class-based factoory
            system); this determination is made on a per-league basis.
        </div>

        <div class="nbt-rules-para">
            Factories have a tech-class designation as well -- a factory is either a Clan or Inner Sphere factory. See
            <a href="#cross-tech">Cross-Tech</a> below for more on how opposing tech affects factory production.

    <div class="nbt-rules-para">
        <h2 class="nbt-h2">Purchasing From Factories</h2>
        <div class="nbt-rules-para">
            Factory purchases are made on a pre-order basis; that is, the order is placed and then the work begins to produce the
            item(s) purchased. If the items are in factory stock at the time the order is placed, the delivery is immediate; otherwise
            the time between the placement of order and delivery of the items is determined by the state of the supply chain for that
            item, as described above. In order to prevent "race conditions" in factory purchasing (which happens when multiple factions
            are waiting to pounce on the first available items off the line), all orders are fulfilled on a first-placed-first-filled basis.
            At the time of order, an "estimated time of delivery" is given to the buyer. The term "estimate" is used deliberately; in a dynamic
            market-based system of production, a super-popular type of combat unit may incur longer delays as more and more of them are
            purchased around the galaxy and the supply chain begins to back up. Therefore, there is no guaranteed time/date of delivery.
            Additionally, the factory owner will always get priority for orders they place, so they can effectively "jump in line" in front
            of other orders for the same combat unit type. Purchasing factions will always be updated as to changes to the estimated delivery,
            as soon as they are known (typically, if the delivery date slips by one or more days). Estimates are re-evaluated every time
            another order for that unit type is placed anywhere in the galaxy, so updated estimates may be sent at irregular intervals.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="nbt-rules-para">
        <h2 class="nbt-h2">Placing An Order</h2>
        <div class="nbt-rules-para">
            Regardless the type of combat or transport unit being purchased, the purchaser must have a dropship or jumpship present on, or
            around, the planet where the factory is located. This allows the factory even to be seen by the purchaser (in the case of non-owned,
            allied factory purchases). This is intended to force the purchaser to consider logistics in prosecuting their military campaigns and
            defenses. Said dropship or jumpship does not need to stay at the planet until delivery is effected (although it is recommended that
            dropships remain behind and serve as a free place in which to take delivery of the product, as mothball charges will be incurred
            for delivery to mothball storage on the factory planet).
        </div>

        <div class="nbt-rules-para">
            Once an order has been placed and funds have cleared, an invoice for the order (marked as "paid") will appear in the purchasing faction's accounting
            interface in the NBT automation. This invoice also contains the estimated delivery date/time for the purchased product, and
            will also automatically receive any updates to the delivery estimate. The purchasing faction has 48 hours from the time of
            order placement to cancel the order with a full refund; after that, a 50% "restocking fee" will be deducted from the invoice
            total for the factory to cancel the order. The order will be put back in factory stock and either made available to fill the next
            invoice in line, or simply be available the next time someone orders that combat unit type.
        </div>

        <div class="nbt-rules-para">
            <span class="bold">Alliances</span>. Alliance levels also factor into the price and fee scale involved in a factory purchase. Discounts
            are increased as the alliance level increases; the specific discount schedule is determined on a per-league basis. A surcharge always
            applies to purchases made at allied factories; this surcharge is paid by the purchaser, but not to the factory owner. The factory
            owner receives a percentage of the purchase price (including surcharge), commensurate with the alliance level. All of these charges and
            fees are prescribed per-league, and all will appear on the invoice.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="nbt-rules-para">
        <h2 class="nbt-h2">Order Delivery</h2>
        <div class="nbt-rules-para">
            As mentioned above, if the purchasing faction has left a dropship behind (with enough capacity to load the full order), the products
            will be delivered to that dropship free of charge. Otherwise, delivery will be made to the factory's "mothball" storage area, and a
            fee assessed for each day the product remains in storage. 7 days after delivery, if the order has not been picked up, it will be
            considered "abandoned" and the purchaser will forfeit all claim to funds tendered. The order will go back into factory stock and
            will be available for purchase by anyone else (including the original purchaser).
        </div>

        <div class="nbt-rules-para">
            Optionally, the purchaser can arrange for delivery of the final product to a planet in their space; this service is not cheap but it
            does allow the purchaser another option in terms of taking delivery of their product. Normal jump times apply, so there could also
            be considerable delay in the delivery of the product. The purchaser may change the planet of delivery at any time prior to completion
            of the order at the factory; after that time, delivery change charges will apply.
        </div>

        <div class="nbt-rules-para">
            If you choose to have the products delivered to the mothball area of the factory planet and the factory planet comes under attack
            after delivery, you may still collect your order and take them off the planet (even if the planet is in full battle lockdowm), but
            you will not be allowed to move them to a primary or allied garrison directly from mothball at any time.

        <h2 class="nbt-h2">Factory Upgrades And Creation</h2>
        <div class="nbt-rules-para">
            Factions may either upgrade existing factories (increase production capacity, add new factory production lines, etc.), or create a
            new factory from scratch. The latter option is by far the most expensive and time-consuming, but it may be the only means by which
            a faction can obtain the military hardware it needs.

            Note that a faction may only create factories of its own class (Clan factions can create or upgrade Clan
            factories; Inner Sphere factions can create or upgrade Inner Sphere factories). This means that an Inner Sphere
            faction, in capturing a Clan factory, can not expand production of Clan technology at that factory -- it is
            stuck at the level it was at capture. The sole exception is <a href="#cross-tech">Cross-Tech</a>, described below.

            technology in question for their scientists to be able to reverse-engineer the technology; the number that
            equates to "enough" in that sentence is determined on a per-league basis, and is counted in terms of combat units
            repaired or stolen as a result of the combat action. Once the faction has reached this number, it may begin expanding
            its own factories to produce the combat unit type or variant in question.
