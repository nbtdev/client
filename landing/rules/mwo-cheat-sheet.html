        The following rules are specific to the NBT-MWO league.
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li class="nbt-bold">NBT-MWO is a tonnage-based (not BV-based) league.</li>
        <li>NBT-MWO drop tonnages are chosen at random in 50-ton increments, from the following ranges. The probability
            function is not 1.0; in other words, the randomness is "weighted" and the weighting can change at any time
            without notice. Notice will only be given if/when the ranges themselves change.
            <ul>
                <li><span class="nbt-bold nbt-highlight">Sector Raids: </span>350-500 tons</li>
                <li><span class="nbt-bold nbt-highlight">Sector Assault (Assault Phase): </span>300-600 tons</li>
                <li><span class="nbt-bold nbt-highlight">Sector Assault (Siege Phase): </span>400-600 tons</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>NBT-MWO will use all games modes from the Mechwarrior:Online game except for Escort. Assault and Incursion are
            only used during the Siege phase of Sector Assaults. Skirmish, Domination and Conquest will be used for the
            remaining types of drops throughout the league. All modes are chosen randomly (not necessarily an equal distribution)
            by the automation. On Assault and Incursion mode drops, the defender will forfeit
            the drop if they "capture" the attacker's base; consider the attacker base as "off-limits" for defenders. The
            symmetric objective modes (Conquest and Domination) are played as normal, with no restrictions.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span class="nbt-bold">Incursion Note:</span> Incursion requires that one base be damaged more than the other.
                    If the defender destroys all attacker mechs, they are required to damage the attacker base in order to end the
                    drop. If the defender destroys all attacker mechs but is so damaged itself that damaging the attacker base will
                    result in the destruction of the last defender units (and a "win" for the attackers), the automation will provide
                    a means of logging this situation. (Note: the Incursion mode will not be enabled until the automation has this
                    support).

            Factions may upgrade the industry on the planets in their space at a cost of between 5 and 13 c-bills per
            c-bill of industry purchased. This factor will change daily and is chosen randomly. The random distribution for
            industry purchases, like those for tonnage distributions, is not evenly distributed and may change at the
            discretion of NBT Administration, without notice or warning. Notice will only be given when/if the range
            of the industry purchase factors change.
